## by Neila Miranda

This is CMPM 121 D1 project. Where I will be amking an audio clicker game like Cookie clicker. Adding a store so there is a way of incresing the count via diffrent objects then just a buttion.

The pumpkin button/clicker style where it gets bigger and brighter when you hover over it, was inspired from riyer4 taco bell clicker game - (<https://riyer4.github.io/cmpm-121-f25-Ria-Iyer-D1/>)

The pumpkin bouncing and the title shaking was inspired from mgembree's frog clicker game with thier frog buttons animations - <https://mgembree.github.io/cmpm-121-f25-mattembree/>
